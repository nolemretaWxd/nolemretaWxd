### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm just someone who's trying to make computer do stuff, and sometimes I'm successful

You can reach me at:
 - Discord: nolemretaW
 - Email: contact@nolemretaw.pl
 
I primarly use C#. But I also somewhat know PHP, Python, and JS.

Might learn some low level language like C or C++ in the future. Or assembly for a simple CPU like MOS Technology 6502
